"""This utility allows one to check equivalency of outputs (defined
   by --output command line parameter) of process_subways.py.

   Due to unordered nature of sets/dicts, two runs of process_subways.py
   even on the same input generate equivalent jsons,
   which cannot be compared with 'diff' command. The compare_jsons() function
   compares two osm_subways.json taking into account possible shuffling of
   dict items and items of some lists, as well as system-specific subtleties.
   This utility is useful to ensure that code improvements which must not
   affect the process_subways.py output really doesn't change it.
